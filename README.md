# battleship-solitaire

## Description

This solver is created in the form of a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). Similar to the common game of battleship, battleship
solitaire is a game where there is a board that may or may not have any hints. Every cell on the board can be a part of a ship or 
water. Each puzzle provides its own constraints:

* row constraints: the number for each row corresponds to the number of ship parts allowed in that row
* column constraints: the number of ship parts allowed in each column
* water constraints: every ship must be surrounded by water
* ship constraints: the number of each type of ship that is present on the final board.
